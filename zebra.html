                    <p>The ZEBRA Online project aimed to modernize the grant application process for Bremen citizens, associations, and organizations by transitioning from outdated offline methods (letters, emails, or faxes) to an efficient online platform. The objective was to design an intuitive and accessible system that allowed users to digitally submit grant applications and track their status in real time. As the UX Researcher and UX Designer, I was responsible for conducting research, defining user journeys, and creating wireframes and concepts, collaborating closely with UI designers and developers to bring the platform to life. The project duration was approximately 6 months.</p>

                        <p>The design process focused on understanding user needs and prioritizing accessibility. Through stakeholder workshops and workflow analysis, I identified pain points and aligned the platform with WCAG AA/AAA standards for inclusivity. Using insights from research, I created user personas and mapped journeys to define the ideal application flow. Key features such as application submission, document uploads, and real-time status tracking were visualized in low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. These were refined collaboratively with stakeholders to balance user needs and business goals. During prototyping, I partnered with UI designers to create high-fidelity prototypes with a mobile-first approach, incorporating accessibility elements like screen-reader compatibility and keyboard navigation. Regular feedback sessions with stakeholders and cross-functional teams drove iterative improvements, ensuring a seamless, efficient, and inclusive platform that modernized the grant application process.</p>
